......................started on 1 jan 2026.................
tracking my progress!!!!

here on 1 st day i revise basic concept yet loop like inputoutput variable and %& this all and did one basic question on the first day 

here on 2 nd day i learn a little in git hub while working on c i learn how to add commint and use some git prompt and also learn about push command how to use it in while working on vs studio  and also learn how our swap function made like seriously i forget how did modulus work so thats reallly imp to do revsion on daily basis amd i try best to learn it hheheee..


here on 3rd day i learned how to chnage directory properly i literally wasted 30 minute while searching how to do but here its simple way to do it ( go in vs and in terminal use ls and copy name of folder or name of it and then in terminal cd repo name and then you are in that directory on which you want to work  like i will cover workflow of git hub too and complete if else for today..
like little work on daily basis its better than doing a lot in one day

its kinda fun while learning but its time taking i will learn as soon as it can )
